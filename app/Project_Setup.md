# How to set up the project from scratch

  1. Create a Business Technolgy Platform (BTP) trial account. 
     1. Go to https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform/trial.html
     1. Click on button _Start your free trial_.
     1. Sign-up and finalize the account creation through the link in the email that is sent to 
        you.
     1. When signing-in for the first time, select the region that is nearest to your 
        location and wait until the account is set up for.

  1. Launch the _Business Application Studio_ and create a _Dev Space_ for the 
     application:
     1. On the _Welcome to SAP BTP Trial_ screen, click on _SAP Business Application 
        Studio_ (top left element under _Quick Tool Access_).
     1. Click the button _Create Dev Space_.
     1. On the top left corner, provide a name for your Dev Space. In our workshop, we 
        used __python_discord_bot__.
     1. On the left hand side under _What kind of application do you want to create_, 
        select _Basic_.
     1. No _Additional SAP Extensions_ (right hand side) are required. Click the button 
        _Create Dev Space_.

     __Note__: The Dev Space is automatically stopped when you are not using it. Simply 
     press the _Play_ button right next to your Dev Space if it is stopped and wait until
     it has started up again.
